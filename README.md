Sales data is complex. So its important to do this is in clear and concise manner. I have used maps, tables and bar charts to calculate this Theses are easy to understand and clearly visible.

I have used interactive elements in my story points, like story bar, filters, tooltips, dropdown tiles. These features makes the story point more customer friendly and user friendly.

The choice of color palette is chosen for reachability and  accessibility. Included Clear Data Labels to avoid confusion.

KPIS like discount, profit and profit ratio is included.
